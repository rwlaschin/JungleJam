Jungle Jam
===========

**Jungle Jam** is a game my son and I are designing.  

You play as T a rambunction tiger cub.  Run through the forest grabbing your food but look out for banannas and rampaging elephants!

It's a work in progress.  We did steal the art from the web so if the art is yours and you don't want us to use it please let me know.

If you'd like to add some art, or contribute to game play let me know.  We'll add a credits page with everyone's name on it.

Enjoy!
